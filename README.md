# yarp-device-ethercat-CiA402 🚀

## Overview 🌟
This repository provides a YARP device plugin for EtherCAT CiA402 drives.

## Compilation 🛠️

### Prerequisites 📋
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.8 or higher)
- [YARP](https://www.yarp.it/)
- [SOEM](https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOEM)

> **Note**: This device has been tested only on Linux systems.

### Build Steps 🧩

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/yarp-device-ethercat-cia402.git
   cd yarp-device-ethercat-cia402
   ```
2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. Configure the project with CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. Install the plugin:
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

## Usage 🚀

### Running the Plugin 🏃‍♂️

After building the project, the plugin can be loaded into a YARP-based application. Make sure the `YARP_DATA_DIRS` environment variable includes the path to the plugin's configuration files:
```bash
export YARP_DATA_DIRS=/path/to/install/share/yarp:$YARP_DATA_DIRS
```

### Configuration ⚙️
The plugin requires a configuration file defining the EtherCAT network and device parameters. An example can be found at: [`config/robot/template_1_motor/config.xml`](config/robot/template_1_motor/config.xml)

To select the drive internal position controller structure, configure:

- `use_simple_pid_mode` — boolean. When `true` the driver sets `0x2002:00 = 1` (Simple PID);
   when `false` it sets `0x2002:00 = 2` (Cascaded PID).

To program *simple PID* gains (only meaningful when `use_simple_pid_mode=true`), provide:

- `simple_pid_kp_nm_per_deg` — list of joint-side Kp values in Nm/deg
- `simple_pid_kd_nm_s_per_deg` — list of joint-side Kd values in Nm*s/deg

The two gain keys are optional as a pair: if exactly one of them is provided the driver
errors out.

When both are present (and `use_simple_pid_mode=true`) the device converts them to the
drive units (mNm/inc and mNm*s/inc), and writes `0x2012:01..03` with Ki clamped to zero.
If `use_simple_pid_mode=false`, any `simple_pid_*` keys are ignored (with a warning) to
avoid programming/printing `0x2012` with the wrong unit interpretation.

See
[`doc/protocol_map.md`](./doc/protocol_map.md) for the conversion details.

### Setting Up `yarprobotinterface` 🛠️
To ensure that the `yarprobotinterface` binary has the correct permissions and can locate its dependencies, execute:

```console
patchelf --add-rpath $(dirname $(dirname $(which yarprobotinterface)))/lib $(which yarprobotinterface)
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep $(which yarprobotinterface)
```

### Example 💡
To run the plugin with a specific configuration:
```bash
yarprobotinterface --config config/robot/template_1_motor/config.xml
```

## Supported Drives 🛠️
This plugin has been primarily tested with Synapticon drives. While it may be compatible with other EtherCAT drive models or manufacturers, some modifications might be necessary to ensure proper functionality. This is due to the plugin’s use of a custom Process Data Object (PDO) mapping, which extends beyond the standard CiA402 specification.

If you're looking to adapt the plugin for different hardware, we encourage you to open an issue or contribute improvements.
